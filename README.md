- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreBaris. I'm from Brazil, still living here. 
- 👀 I’m mostly interested in the backend development. Especially creating API`s with ExpressJS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new agile software development techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some game development. I'ts simple, but it's a start: already did some translation for a couple of games(Using JSON files). Started to code with C++ on the Unreal Engine 5, it was fun!
